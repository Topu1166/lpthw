Can you explain why the 'return' values are 'candy_quanty' and 'money_left' where we also have other variables like: 'cake_expense' and 'remaining_money'? Why didn't we use 'cake_expense' and 'remaining_money' instead of candy_quantity and money_left? Can you explain in detail and Why?

Certainly! Let's break down the logic and reasoning behind the return values of the function.

cake_expense and remaining_money: These variables are intermediate values used in the calculation process within the function. They represent the total expense for purchasing cakes and the amount of money left after purchasing cakes, respectively. While they are essential for the internal logic of the function, they don't directly represent the final results that the caller of the function is interested in.

candy_quantity and money_left: These variables represent the final results that the caller of the function is interested in. After executing the function, the caller wants to know how many candies they can buy with the remaining money and how much money will be left after purchasing candies.

Here's why we return candy_quantity and money_left instead of cake_expense and remaining_money:

Clarity and Relevance: The function's purpose is to determine how many candies can be bought with the remaining money after purchasing cakes. Therefore, the return values should directly relate to this purpose. candy_quantity and money_left provide clear and relevant information about the final outcome of the calculation.

Ease of Use: By returning candy_quantity and money_left, the function provides the caller with the specific information they need without requiring them to perform additional calculations or interpret intermediate values. This makes the function more user-friendly and easier to integrate into other parts of the code.

Modularity and Encapsulation: Returning only the necessary information (candy_quantity and money_left) promotes modularity and encapsulation. The caller doesn't need to be concerned with the internal details of how the function calculates the results; they only need to know the final outcome. This separation of concerns improves code readability, maintainability, and reusability.

In summary, while cake_expense and remaining_money are important for the function's internal calculations, candy_quantity and money_left are the more relevant and meaningful return values that provide the caller with the desired information about the final outcome of the operation.
