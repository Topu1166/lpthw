2. File & Folder Management 
| Task          | Command                   | Notes                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |

#### Extra Tips for Week 1 
(a) Try using tab completion: type part of a command or 
    filename and press Tab to auto-pomplete.
(b) Use man <command> to read the manual. Example: man ls. 
(c) Practice these commands daily for at least 30-60 min. 
    Muscle memory is key.
